# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

@AGENTS.md

The project overview, build/test/lint commands, architecture, proxy mode, and coding
rules all live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), so Codex, Kimi, and any other contributing
agent get the same reference Claude Code does. Only the three sections below are
genuinely Claude Code session-management behavior, not rtk coding rules, so they stay
here.

## Working Directory Confirmation

**ALWAYS confirm working directory before starting any work**:

```bash
pwd  # Verify you're in the rtk project root
git branch  # Verify correct branch (main, feature/*, etc.)
```

**Never assume** which project to work in. Always verify before file operations.

## Avoiding Rabbit Holes

**Stay focused on the task**. Do not make excessive operations to verify external APIs, documentation, or edge cases unless explicitly asked.

**Rule**: If verification requires more than 3-4 exploratory commands, STOP and ask the user whether to continue or trust available info.

**Examples of rabbit holes to avoid**:
- Excessive regex pattern testing (trust snapshot tests, don't manually verify 20 edge cases)
- Deep diving into external command documentation (use fixtures, don't research git/cargo internals)
- Over-testing cross-platform behavior (test macOS + Linux, trust CI for Windows)
- Verifying API signatures across multiple crate versions (use docs.rs if needed, don't clone repos)

**When to stop and ask**:
- "Should I research X external API behavior?" → ASK if it requires >3 commands
- "Should I test Y edge case?" → ASK if not mentioned in requirements
- "Should I verify Z across N platforms?" → ASK if N > 2

## Plan Execution Protocol

When user provides a numbered plan (QW1-QW4, Phase 1-5, sprint tasks, etc.):

1. **Execute sequentially**: Follow plan order unless explicitly told otherwise
2. **Commit after each logical step**: One commit per completed phase/task
3. **Never skip or reorder**: If a step is blocked, report it and ask before proceeding
4. **Track progress**: Use task list (TaskCreate/TaskUpdate) for plans with 3+ steps
5. **Validate assumptions**: Before starting, verify all referenced file paths exist and working directory is correct
