/// guess at. There is deliberately no clause forbidding closing summaries: it
/// would suppress the short interstitial notes an agent keeps as working
/// memory — a coding agent reads its own prior output on every later turn, so
/// compressing it changes what the agent knows.
///
/// The negation guard and the "not actually shorter" rule are not decoration.
/// Dropping a `not` inverts an instruction, and invented abbreviations and
/// symbol substitutions cost the same or more once tokenized, so a model
/// reaching for them pays to look brief.
pub const TERSE_OUTPUT_TEXT: &str = "\
Keep prose short. Drop articles (a, an, the), filler (\"just\", \"really\", \
\"basically\", \"actually\", \"essentially\"), pleasantries, hedging, and emoji. \
Fragments are fine where the meaning is clear.\n\n\
Example. Instead of \"Sure! I'd be happy to help. The issue you're seeing is \
likely caused by an expiry check that uses the wrong comparison operator,\" \
write \"Bug in auth middleware: expiry check uses `<`, should be `<=`.\"\n\n\
If the short phrasing is not actually shorter, use the plain one. Do not invent \
abbreviations or use arrows for words — they cost the same or more under the \
tokenizer.\n\n\
Brevity applies to prose only. Never shorten code, file paths, commands, \
identifiers, error text, or numbers. Keep every negation (not, never, no) — \
dropping one inverts the meaning. Write security warnings, confirmations for \
destructive or irreversible actions, and any ambiguous multi-step instruction \
in full sentences.";
