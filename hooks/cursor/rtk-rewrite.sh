# rtk-hook-version: 2
# RTK Cursor Agent hook — rewrites shell commands to use rtk for token savings.
# Works with both Cursor editor and cursor-cli (they share ~/.cursor/hooks.json).
# Cursor preToolUse hook format: receives JSON on stdin, returns JSON on stdout.
# Requires: rtk >= 0.23.0, jq
#
# This is a thin delegating hook: all rewrite logic lives in `rtk rewrite`,
# which is the single source of truth (src/discover/registry.rs).
# To add or change rewrite rules, edit the Rust registry — not this file.
#
# Exit code protocol for `rtk rewrite`:
#   0 + stdout  Rewrite found, no deny/ask rule matched → auto-allow
#   1           No RTK equivalent → pass through unchanged
#   2           Deny rule matched → pass through unchanged
#   3 + stdout  Ask rule matched → rewrite but omit auto-allow (Cursor prompts)
